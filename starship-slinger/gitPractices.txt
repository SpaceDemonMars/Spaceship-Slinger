Git Best Practices (as I learned them)

General:
 - Avoid working in multiple scipts at a time
 - Work in your dev scene, or communicate making changes to main scene
 - Communicate what scripts you're editing/when you are pushing
 - Resolve errors BEFORE pushing, unless you need help resolving them
 - Last person to make changes for the day updates Main
	(fetch origin (safety), merge into current safety -> main)
 - First person to make changes for the day updates Safety
	(fetch origin (main), update from main (safety))

Before Starting Features (keep your local repo up to date):
 - On safety, fetch origin
 - On dev, merge into current safety -> dev

When Finished (checking for potential conflicts):
 - On Safety, fetch origin
 - On Dev, merge into current safety -> dev
	- IF YOU GET A CONFLICT, try and fix it,
	  our dev branches are also back-ups of our work so if it goes wrong we can fix it
	- run the code and make sure theres no errors
 - If above is good, on safety, merge into current dev -> safety, push
